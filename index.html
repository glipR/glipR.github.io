                                I currently tutor at Monash University, and am working on a few projects.<br>
                                I speak English, Python, GDScript, and on occasion C++ and JavaScript.

                                My main interests are in mathematics, computer science, and education, and I naturally tend to find intersection between the three.<br>
                                These interests fuel many of the ideas for my ongoing projects, checkout the <a href="#projects">Projects</a> page to see that.

                            FIT1045 is the first introduction to the Computer Science degree.<br>
                            It mainly focuses on the basics of programming, introducing this through Python.

                            It starts by tackling what computers do at a much lower level, requiring students to write MIPS code.<br>
                            Then the more theoretical parts of computer science are introduced fully, such as Runtime Complexity.

                            MTH3170 is one of the capstone units at Monash, and builds many theorems about graphs from the ground up.<br>
                            This starts with the basics of Graph Theory, then continues to discuss algorithms and theorems on Matchings and Flows,<br>
                            then finishes by discussing planarity, colouring, Ramsey theory and the probabilistic method.

                        <p>
                            MAST20026 gets student's accustomed to formal proof-writing concepts, and does this through the basics of Real Analysis.<br>
                            Spending most of its time in definitions of continuity and derivative, and only touching on a few theorems (IVT and the like), this unit is very beginner-friendly.

                            Previously AIArena, this is our most ambitious of contests, in which we create a game and teams are tasked with writing a bot to play the game.
                            This ran with great success in 2021, and we are planning an even bigger competition for 2022.<br><br>

                            <h2>FHIR Competition</h2>
                            We've ran 3 of these since their inception in early 2020.<br>
                            These contests are centered around use of the FHIR data spec for digital health applications.<br><br>

                            I'm one of the mentors at my old highschool robotics club.

                            Over the years this has meant I've been working on:<br><br>

                            This is a bit of robotics simulation software I wrote to tackle our problem of Robotics online-learning in 2020.<br>
                            Hasn't been updated in a while, but was written in such a way to support custom environments, many of which live on in Brains4Bots<br><br>

                            <h2><a href="https://brains4bots.site/">Brains4Bots</a></h2>
                            This is a somewhat retired project I used to extend the functionality of EV3Sim to teach students Python through solving, not through textbooks.<br>
                            There are some documents made, but for now I've stopped working on it (To take most of the concepts and mantra into my new secret project)<br><br>

                                    Portal 2 is one of those special games that feels like it was made for me.<br>
                                    The comedy, concept, voice-acting, difficulty and atmosphere are all perfectly executed.<br>
                                    While Portal is a lonely, quiet game (which it executes very well), Portal 2 is a hilarious and thoughtful second entry into the franchise.

                            Portal 2 shaped most all of my humour, got me interested in programming, and taught me a lot about what makes a good puzzle / class.

                                    Undertale tells stories in a way I haven't experienced before or since playing it in 2020.<br>
                                    Luckily enough I was able to play it knowing barely anything about it before then, except for funny blue eye man.<br>
                                    This entire experience is a deeply personal one, shared only with the lead developer, discussing your choices in a level of detail that speaks to the passion this game has received from Toby Fox.

                                    Celeste came along at a rough time in my life, and tackled many of the same problems I was facing - problems of identity, anxiety, and purpose.<br>
                                    It's also one of the few games I can think of that truly links the game concept and mechanics to the story itself. By the time chapter 7 turned around, I had fully identified with Madeline, and her triumphs were my triumphs.

                            No other game has made me smile and cry like Celeste has, and I think this is because no other game tells a story quite like Celeste does.<br>
                            It'd be remiss of me not to mention how good of a <i>videogame</i> Celeste is. It is the single-player game I've played the most (by a long shot), due in no small part to how rewarding/deep the gameplay is, and sense of flow you get, not to mention the vibrant modding community. PLAY CELESTE.

                                    Chicory tells a wonderful story. For me that story was about what makes someone strong.<br>
                                    Someone strong is proud of their work, and stands up for those around them. While this might seem obvious, it was something I needed to hear.<br>
                                    This game also touches on the potential of every person to realise amazing things, something that I think is missing from a lot of today's media with superheroes and the supernatural.<br>
                                    Chicory is my #1 recommendation for anyone who hasn't really played many games but wants to give it a shot.

                            I should also mention this games soundtrack. It's personally my favourite out of any videogame, by a good margin. This is in part because it was a 1-person endeavour, and I think this results in a more personal, touching OST.
